# Platform Tilt

This repository tracks technical issues in major software platforms which disadvantage Firefox relative to the first-party browser. We consider aspects like security, stability, performance, and functionality, and propose changes to create a more level playing field.

You can read the issues on the [dashboard](https://mozilla.github.io/platform-tilt/), which is built from the content in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mozilla/platform-tilt/issues).
